# subjective-answer-analysis
Examination and evaluation are part of every course module . Automated systems for objective based examination are already available but subjective examination are in need of time as subjective assessment is considered as best way of evaluation of ones subject understanding & knowledge. In this project we aim to create an automated system to evaluate subjective answer for every exam conducted in the department and to generate reports for students , teachers as well as parents.
